Context
The RRUFF Project in partnership with International Mineralogical Association (IMA) is creating a complete set of high quality spectral data from well characterized minerals and is developing the technology to share this information with the world.

Content
Dataset include mineral name, unique formula (RRUFF and IMA) in plain text (f.e., Abellaite is NaPb2+2(CO3)2(OH) which means NaPb²⁺₂(CO₃)₂(OH)), IMA number and RUFF ids, chemistry elements, countries of location, structural group. age.
